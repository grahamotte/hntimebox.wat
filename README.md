# RAILSGUN

Railsgun is a Rails-based launchpad application designed to be as *cheap as possible*.

It handles all the usual stuff you would want in a web app:

- Rails backend including many common gems
- React frontend
- Postgres DB
- Redis caching
- Sidekiq job running
- Let's encrypt certificates
- Network mounts
- and some other goodies...

## Setup

Railsgun was built for me, so it's pretty opinionated, but if you want to run it here's what you'll need:

1. Create these secrets, and put them in these locations:

```
~/.config/secrets/linode_token
~/.config/secrets/cloudflare_token
~/.config/secrets/secrets.yml # rails secrets yml file
~/.config/secrets/rclone.conf # generated by rclone
~/.config/secrets/id_rsa # keyfile for deployment
~/.config/secrets/id_rsa.pub
```

2. Register a domain and point is nameservers to cloudflare

3. Fork this repo, the name of your fork should be the domain name of your project

4. Run `bin/dev` to test your app locally

5. Run `bin/prod deploy` to deploy, this will take about 30 minutes.
